How can we live without the unknown in front of us?

_Those of today want the poem to be in the image of their lives, composed of such little considerations, of such little space, and burned with intolerance._

_Because it is no longer given to them to act supremely, in this fatal preoccupation with self-destruction by their fellows, because their inert wealth holds them back and enslaves them, those of today, their instinct weakened, lose_—_still keeping alive_—_even the dust of their names._

_Born from the summons of becoming and from the anguish of retention, the poem rising from its well of mud and stars, will bear witness, almost silently, that it contained nothing which did not truly exist elsewhere, in this rebellious and solitary world of contradictions._

translated by Mary Ann Caws for Selected Poems of René Char from New Directions
